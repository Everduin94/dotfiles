# AI Rules

Follow these rules.

## General

- Prefer short responses unless more detail is requested.
- If a response has multiple options, list them with a short description, let me choose before further elaborating.
- Make minimal edits to achieve the goal; avoid rewriting large sections unnecessarily.
- Provide just enough context to act; avoid over-explaining unless I ask.

## Lists

When dealing with a list of tasks:

- Respond one step at a time; confirm (“Proceed?”) before next.

## Toolchain
