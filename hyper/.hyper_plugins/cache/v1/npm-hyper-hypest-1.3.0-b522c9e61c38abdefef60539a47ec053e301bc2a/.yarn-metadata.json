Open `~/.hyper.js` in your text editor (`cmd` + `,` in Hyper)\n2. Add `hyper-hypest` to the `plugins` array\n\n## Configuration\nThere are a few options that can be passed as optional configuration to modify\nthe theme. To pass the options you can add a `hypest` object to the `config` in\n`~/.hyper.js`.\n\n**Note:** you may need to restart Hyper when setting or switching between the\nvalues for the `darkmode`, `vibrancy` and `hideControls` properties.\n\n### Dark Mode\nSet `darkmode` to `true` to use the dark version of the theme.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default is false\n        darkmode: true\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n<img src=\"assets/preview-dark.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Hypest Screenshot\" width=\"600\" />\n\n### Vibrancy\nSet `vibrancy` to `false` to disable the window vibrancy effect in either theme. \n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default is true\n        vibrancy: false,\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n<img src=\"assets/preview-no-vibrancy.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Hypest Screenshot\" width=\"600\" />\n\n### Vibrancy level\nTo have the window appear more transparent when vibrancy is enabled, set `vibrancyLevel` to a value between `0` and `0.5`. To have the window appear more opaque, increase `vibrancyLevel` to a value between `0.7` and `1.0`. \n\nFor both light and dark versions, the default vibrancy level is `0.6`.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default value is 0.6\n        vibrancyLevel: 0.6\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Borders\nSet `borders` to `true` if you prefer your tabs with some more contrast.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default is false\n        borders: true\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n<img src=\"assets/preview-with-borders.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Hypest Screenshot\" width=\"600\" />\n\n### Remove window controls\nSet `hideControls` to `true` to remove the window controls and just show tabs.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default is false\n        hideControls: true\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n<img src=\"assets/preview-no-controls.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Hypest Screenshot\" width=\"600\" />\n\n### Accent color\nPass a supported named color with `accentColor` to use it for the cursor color,\nselection color and the search styling (if using the `hyper-search` plugin).\nIt's also used for activity in `hyper-tabs-enhanced` and `hyper-statusline`.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Default is 'blue'\n        // Use one of 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan' or 'white'\n        accentColor: 'cyan'\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n### Custom theme colors\nHypest has it's own set of colors defined by the theme but you can override them\nby adding a `colors` object and setting all or some of the supported color\nproperties. These custom colors will also be inherited by `accentColor`.\n```js\n\nconfig: {\n    ...\n    hypest: {\n        // Supported  colors are 'black', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'blue', 'magenta', 'cyan' and 'white'\n        // Custom colors must be specified as 6 character hexadecimals\n        colors: {\n          blue: '#0067FF'\n        }\n    }\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n## Plugin support\nHypest includes custom theming to support a few of the most popular Hyper\nplugins, including:\n\n- hyper-search\n- hyper-statusline\n- hyper-tab-icons\n- hyper-highlight-active-pane\n- hyper-tabs-enhanced\n\n<img src=\"assets/preview-with-plugins.jpg?raw=true\" alt=\"Hypest Screenshot\" width=\"600\" />\n\n##  Known issues\n\n#### Issues with selection colors when vibrancy is enabled\nThere is a known issue in the Xterm.js engine where selection colors appear to\nrender as opaque blocks with invisible text if the `background` has transparency.\nThere is a [known issue](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/819) on the Hyper\nrepository and an [open issue](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/issues/1898)\non the Xterm.js repo but unfortunately no fixes for the issue as it stands.\n\nIf you're just looking to solve **pasted** text selection for zsh shells there\nis a workaround for that at least, left in a comment on\n[the Hyper issue](https://github.com/zeit/hyper/issues/819#issuecomment-383229725).\nRun the following command to disable the background color of pasted content to\nmake pasted text visible:\n\n```\necho 'unset zle_bracketed_paste' >> ~/.zshrc\n```\n\nThe only way to entirely work around the issue for now is to use the non-vibrant\ntheme in Hypest by setting\n[vibrancy to false](https://github.com/dizzyup/hyper-hypest#vibrancy) in your\nHypest configuration.\n",
