hyper-night-owl is a beautiful theme for the Hyper terminal based on the [Night Owl VS Code dark theme](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme), which is optimized for working at night, accessibility, and colorblindness.

This code for this theme is based on the [Verminal Hyper terminal theme](https://github.com/defringe/verminal).

## üõ† Install

Installing the hyper-night-owl theme for your Hyper terminal couldn't be easier.

###### Hyper's built-in CLI (hyper)

1.  `hyper i hyper-night-owl`
1.  Enjoy hyper-night-owl.

###### Manually

1.  Open `~/.hyper.js` in your favorite editor.
1.  Add `hyper-night-owl` to the `plugins` array.
1.  Enjoy hyper-night-owl.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure

By default, hyper-night-owl aims to deliver a beautiful experience out of the box. By default, it does not supply a transparent background, however, if you'd like to have this, I recommend installing and configuring the [hyper-opacity](https://hyper.is/plugins/hyper-opacity) plugin.
