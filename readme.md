# üëã Welcome to my Dotfiles

- Neovim
- Wezterm
- Zsh + Zap
- MacOS
- Arch Linux + AwesomeWM

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is managed by stow. The file structure is based on running stow from the OS level folder names "all", "mac" and "arch".


## üì¶ Installation

These dotfiles are managed by gnu stow. You can install individual modules of these dotfiles, for example `nvim`, based on your needs / OS. This will create a symlink to the module in your `~/.config` or `$HOME` directory, depending on the module.

```sh
# In your $HOME directory
git clone https://github.com/Everduin94/dotfiles.git

# Install stow with your package manager
brew install stow

# Navigate to the folder containing the module you want to install
cd ~/dotfiles/all
stow -t ~ nvim

# üîÑ Rinse and repeat for all desired modules.
```

> [!NOTE]
> This example will clone all of my dotfiles, but will only install the `nvim` module into your `~/.config` directory. Modules will not impact your editor/terminal unless stowed.

> [!WARNING]
> These instructions are high level, and some dependencies may be out of date or missing. It may be better to take inspiration from these dotfiles instead of using them directly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Some configuration will be required depending on the modules you installed. For example:

- Updating the `git` module to use your name / email
- Updating the `projects` list to point to your projects.
  - The `p` command from the `zsh` module will open an FZF prompt of those projects.
- The list of dependencies for these dotfiles may be out of date. If something doesn't work, you may just be missing a dependency that needs to be installed via `npm` or your package manager (`brew`, `pacman`, etc...)

## üñ•Ô∏è Arch Setup (WIP)


> [!NOTE]
> The pacman & yay lists of dependencies are missing. But, you can still use the `arch` section for inspiration. Or stow and try to figure out missing dependencies through trial and error.
