### Potential Issues
Vim plugs did not push content to remote (July, 2021) (Unresolved)
- Will PluggedInstall fix?
  - If not, create submodules

The first time I tried to make a submodule, index already exists exception
- *Note*: vim sneak for example, still works on my work machine.

### Future Improvements
Need installation script 
- mv all existing/conflicting dotfiles to temp
- create symlinks for every dotfile
- install brew if mac
  - install brew tools 
  - install fish if mac

### Goal
**Version control all of my dotfiles**

#### STATUS: COMPLETE

### Goal
**Run installation Script on another machine**

#### STATUS: LOW PRIORITY
