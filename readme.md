### Potential Issues
- vim plugs did not push content to remote
- Will PluggedInstall fix?
  - If not, create submodules
	- The first time I tried to make a submodule, index already exists exception
        - *Note*, vim sneak for example, still works on my work machine.
- fish will need to be installed, what else? -- On windows, that might be a problem, bash script?

### Future Improvements
- Need installation script (Assumed Workflow)
  - mv all existing/conflicting dotfiles to temp
  - create symlinks for every dotfile
- Need list + links of all the things I need to install. -- Refer to "Documents/tools"
- If it's a mac, we want to install brew & fish.
  - Note it can't be a fish script or else it won't work in windows :(

### Goal
- Version control all of my dotfiles
- This way I can keep compounding changes, history, aliases, etc... across machines
- i.e. the week I spent setting up this machine, I removed 80% (?) of the effort for the next setup.
